For a loading fee on transactions through UPI, payments banks, for instance, can widen the adoption of wallets among customers and merchants. Thisincreaseuse cases for UPI, which largely works on a model of free peer- to- peer- merchant transactions. The opportunity provided by the scorching growth of UPI transactions must, however, cross the hurdle of consumerbehaviorthat is shaped by zero fees for payments made from their bank accounts. For survival, payments banks - which can accept deposits but are prohibited from lending, need to be part of the UPI ecosystem. They also need to carve out a distinct business segment where they have an advantage over full-service banks.Those use cases are expected to grow as UPI diversifies into cross-border remittances, introduces consumer lending throughRuPaycredit cards and offers currency exchange to foreigntravelers, and bill payments using standing instructions gain traction. UPI will also have to integrate with the digital rupee that is undergoing tests for retail and wholesale transactions. The digital payments platform will continue to play a key role in the infrastructure that is being developed around contactless payments.This involves building additional UPI context around digital transactions such as billing and credit- profiling. Initial adoption has surpassed the most optimistic expectations. But that is principally on account of the waiver of the merchant discount rate. In the next leg, UPI will grow by providing solutions for the conduct of business. It will have to incorporate lending at some point to become a comprehensive medium of commerce. The infrastructure must encourage fin-techs to push innovation in finance. Payments banks have a strong correlation with the growth of digital transactions. They are vital piece of the machinery being built. The interoperability with UPI guidelines plugs them deeper.Given below are two statements:Statement I:Initial UPI adoption has surpassed the most optimistic expectations on account of the waiver of the merchant discount rate.Statement II:The future growth of the UPI will be facilitated by providing solution for the conduct of business and to becoming a medium of commerce.In the light of the above statements, choose the most appropriate answer from the options given below:</div>

Until very recently, the prevalent technology was simply not available or very limited to allow work away from office. If you had to conduct stocktaking, copy documents or engage in a brainstorming session, one had to be physically close to the tools of work and co-workers. Even as the technology was becoming increasingly available, it was the forced disruption of pandemic that finally showed that office, like the stock exchange trading floor, as a shared physical-only space was no longer essential to carry out work. Today, as Covid restrictions thankfully recede, the push that had become the shove of working from home (WFH) is becoming a nudge for working from anywhere (WFA).Neither can all work be conducted WFA nor to all workers prefer remote working. Several reasons for the primacy of the "face-to-face' work model are trotted out - 'water-cooler' engagements; ideas flying 'better' at corporeally attended meeting; company values welded only under 'one roof, one team' norms. But studies, including pre-pandemic ones conducted by the likes of Harvard Business School's Prithviraj Choudhury, have shown that WFA is a 'win-win for 'Workers, Companies and for Society'. WFA slashes time and energy expanded in commutes; allows workers the choice of their work surroundings that mayactually improvetheir quantitative and qualitative output; provides less crowded space for those who choose offices as their comfort work zone. Most importantly, for companies, it allows HFA - hiring from anywhere, thereby breaking the talent pool distance barrier.The new hybrid work culture is still a work-in progress. Floor managers will have to be trained to manage a different kind of floor. Company values will need to flourish in a digital-deeper environment.

Until very recently, the prevalent technology was simply not available or very limited to allow work away from office. If you had to conduct stocktaking, copy documents or engage in a brainstorming session, one had to be physically close to the tools of work and co-workers. Even as the technology was becoming increasingly available, it was the forced disruption of pandemic that finally showed that office, like the stock exchange trading floor, as a shared physical-only space was no longer essential to carry out work. Today, as Covid restrictions thankfully recede, the push that had become the shove of working from home (WFH) is becoming a nudge for working from anywhere (WFA).Neither can all work be conducted WFA nor to all workers prefer remote working.

The system creates biometric IDs to establish proof of residence and has been instrumental in digitizing financial transactions, among other benefits. This initiative is now part of India Stack, a decentralized public utility offering a low-cost comprehensive digital identity, payment and data management system. "IndiaStackis likely to lead to a massive change in how India spends, borrows and accesses healthcare", says an expert.IndiaStackhas broad applications including a network for lowering credit costs, making loans more accessible and affordable for both consumers and businesses. Credit availability is an important component of economic growth, and "India is currently one of the most under leveraged countries in the world", says the expert, whose team thinks the ratio of credit to GDP could increase from 57% to 100% over the next decade. Indian consumers are also likely to have more disposable income. India's income distribution could flip over the next decade, and consequently overall consumption in the country could be more than double from $2 trillion in 2022 to $4.9 trillion by the end of the decade - with the greatest gains going to non-grocery retail, including apparel and accessories, leisure and recreation, and household goods and services, among other categories.Which one of the following explains Aadhaar?</div>

The amendments disallow losses on the sale of one crypto asset to be set off against gains on another. No deduction is permitted for any expenditure other than the cost of acquisition for computation of income from sale of cryptos and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Every transfer of crypto assets will be taxed at the proposed 30% rate, irrespective of whether they are a capital asset or not. Only the proposed 1% rate of tax deducted at source will apply to transactions in digital assets. Penalties have been imposed for taxpayers who have claimed a deduction of surcharge and cess from their taxable income, but have not, on their own accord, paid the tax and interest on the deduction they have claimed.The inability to set off losses will skew the risk-reward profile of digital assets, and crypto exchanges fear it could push trading activity beyond Indian jurisdiction to decentralized exchanges and foreign platforms, accessed through virtual private networks. The industry feels not allowing tax deduction on the costs of mining cryptos will eventually force blockchain companies and the talent they hire to operate outside the country. To the extent that the proposed tax regime drives users from exchanges compliant with know-your-customer (KYC) rules towards underground peer-to-peer platforms, deterrence would be diluted.Nirmala Sitharaman, in her statement, while moving the amendments, has clarified the tax on private digital assets does not indicateGoTsstance on their legitimacy. The regulatory position could become clearer once the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is ready with its digital currency. Fiat digital currencies, which make transactions and monetary transmission more efficient, are inevitable as the use of cash plateaus in several countries.

No deduction is permitted for any expenditure other than the cost of acquisition for computation of income from sale of cryptos and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Every transfer of crypto assets will be taxed at the proposed 30% rate, irrespective of whether they are a capital asset or not. Only the proposed 1% rate of tax deducted at source will apply to transactions in digital assets. Penalties have been imposed for taxpayers who have claimed a deduction of surcharge and cess from their taxable income, but have not, on their own accord, paid the tax and interest on the deduction they have claimed.The inability to set off losses will skew the risk-reward profile of digital assets, and crypto exchanges fear it could push trading activity beyond Indian jurisdiction to decentralized exchanges and foreign platforms, accessed through virtual private networks. The industry feels not allowing tax deduction on the costs of mining cryptos will eventually force blockchain companies and the talent they hire to operate outside the country. To the extent that the proposed tax regime drives users from exchanges compliant with know-your-customer (KYC) rules towards underground peer-to-peer platforms, deterrence would be diluted.Nirmala Sitharaman, in her statement, while moving the amendments, has clarified the tax on private digital assets does not indicateGoTsstance on their legitimacy. The regulatory position could become clearer once the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is ready with its digital currency. Fiat digital currencies, which make transactions and monetary transmission more efficient, are inevitable as the use of cash plateaus in several countries. Speculation, and a reflex to curb it, must not draw attention away from the inherent superiority of digital currencies. This is the future of money.Digital currency regulations will result into which one of the following?</div>

He bumped into Kamath, GM (Materials), threw the resignation letter on his table, shouted and walked out of the room swiftly.Naik has reason for his sudden outburst. He has been driven to the wall. Perhaps, details of the story will tell the reasons for Naik’s bile and why he put in his papers, barely four months after he took up his present assignment.The year was 2021 when Naik quit the prestigious SAIL plant atVishakapatnam. As amanager materials, Naik enjoyed powers - he could even place an order for materials worth Rs. 25lakh. He needed nobody's prior approval.Naik joined a pulp-making plant located at Harihar in Karnataka, as AGM Materials. The plant is a part of the multi-product andmultiplant-conglomerate owned by a prestigious business house in India.Obviously, perks, designation and reputation of the conglomerate lured Naik away from the public sector steel monolith.When he joined the eucalyptus pulp making company, little did Naik realise that he needed prior approval to place an order for materials worth Rs. 12lakh. He had presumed that he had the authority to place an order by himself worth half the amount of what he used to do at the mega steel maker. He placed the order, materials arrived, were received, accepted and used up in the plant.Trouble started when the bill for Rs. 12lakhcame from the vendor. The accounts department withheld paymentfor the reason thatthe bill was not endorsed by Kamath.

It would boost value addition on-site, reaping economies of scale and scope, reduce logistical and sourcing expenses, and generally step up sector-specific competitive advantage across the board.The value chain in yarn, fabrics and ready-mades is scattered and quite fragmented nation-wide.

In this method, costs are accumulated for a specific batch of products or services that are produced under a single order. This approach is particularly useful in industries where production occurs in distinct batches rather than in a continuous flow. Job costing methods apply to various sectors, including manufacturing and service industries, where specific contracts or orders dictate the production. The key characteristic of batch costing is that each batch can have different costs associated with it, similar to individual jobs in job costing.</span></span></p></div>

While both batch costing and job costing methods involve tracking costs for specific production runs, the key distinction lies in how the cost units are defined. In job costing, each job is treated as a separate cost unit, while in batch costing, costs are aggregated for each batch produced. This method allows for efficient cost allocation and management when products are manufactured in groups, which is common in many industries.</span></span></p></div>

These costs typically include materials, </span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">labor</span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">, and other direct expenses necessary to complete the contract.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">To determine the profit or loss from a contract, the contractor prepares a Contract Account, where all incurred expenses are debited, and the income from work certified is credited. The difference between these amounts indicates the profit or loss on the contract. This method emphasizes the tracking of direct costs associated with the specific contract, as opposed to job or batch costing, which may involve more indirect expenses. Additionally, in contract costing, it is common to debit the opening balance of assets used in the contract and credit the closing balance, focusing on the direct costs that are crucial for accurately assessing financial performance on the project.</span></span></p></div>

These losses are typically due to unforeseen circumstances, such as accidents or equipment failures. Since they are not a regular part of the production process, the costs associated with abnormal loss should not be charged to the good units. Instead, they should be treated separately in the financial records, ensuring that the cost of the good units reflects only the normal production expenses. Thus, the treatment of abnormal loss helps maintain accurate cost accounting and ensures that only the relevant costs are attributed to the units produced.</span></span></p></div>

These support activities can include setup, quality control, material handling, and other overhead functions. By involving and considering these various support activities, ABC provides a more precise and granular breakdown of costs. This accurate allocation helps in understanding the true cost of each product or service. </span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">By adopting a more forensic approach to assigning overheads, ABC can provide a more accurate cost figure for each unit of output. This should help in assessing product profit- ability and in making pricing and product mix decisions. ABC can also help managers gain a better understanding of business operations. This, in turn, should help improve performance.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Despite its apparent advantages, critics point out that ABC can be a costly exercise. Setting up the costing system, as well as updating it, can consume a great deal of resources. Running an ABC system can also be complex and time-consuming, particularly where business operations involve </span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">a large number of</span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt"> activities and cost drivers. Management reports generated from a complex costing system are also likely to be com- plex. If managers find these reports difficult to understand, the potential benefits of employing ABC may be lost. </span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Where products or services have similar levels of output involving similar activities and processes, or where overheads form a relatively low proportion of the total costs, the more accurate measurements provided by ABC are unlikely to lead to strikingly different outcomes from those obtained under the </span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">traditional approach. As a result, opportunities for better pricing, planning and cost control may be few. If this were the case, switching to an ABC system would be difficult to justify. </span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Measurement and tracing problems may arise with ABC. Not all costs can be easily traced to a particular activity. Nevertheless, all activity costs </span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">have to</span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt"> be assigned to one cost pool or another. To ensure that all these costs are considered, some may be assigned to cost pools on an arbitrary basis. Poor quality data on activity costs may also lead to arbitrary cost assignments. A final problem is that the relationship between activity costs and their cost drivers may be difficult to determine. Identifying a cause-and-effect relationship can be difficult where activity costs are fixed and do not change with changes in operating activities. Finally, ABC is criticized for the same reason that traditional full costing is criticised – it does not provide relevant information for decision making.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Thus, based on above explanation, option A is the correct answer.</span></span></p></div>
