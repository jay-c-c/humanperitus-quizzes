                    <div class="question-text">Read the following passage and answer the question:Findings of a survey on stress during COVID times conducted by a global professional network in India during 3rdquarter of 2021, narrated here below:India’s overall workforce confidence remained steady with a composite score of +55 from July 31 to September 24, 2021, despite drastic transformations in the world of work. But keeping up with these times of change for the last 18 months has adversely affected the mental health of working professionals in the country. When asked to share their primary reasons for work stress, employed professionals cited ‘balancing work with personal needs’ (34%), ‘not making enough money’ (32%), and ‘slow career advancement’ (25%) as the top three stressors at work today. Amid such stressful times, 1 in 3 professionals are also seen drawing optimism from the availability of jobs (36%) and improved control over expenses (30%) in today’s recovering, yet competitive jobs marketplace. As workforce priorities continue to change in these transformative times, findings go on to indicate that flexibility and work-life balance will serve as critical talent drivers across the Indian professional landscape for years to come. While greater flexibility remains a mutual need across generations, younger professionals found it easier to take a break than their older cohorts. Findings reveal that millennials were 2xmore likely to take time-offs, while Gen Z professionals were 1.5xmore likely to take breaks during the day, when compared to Baby Boomers. Interestingly, boomers were 1.5xmore likely to be open with their colleagues about mental health and stress when compared to millennials as well as Gen Z professionals.There’s a wide gap between what employees need and what employees need and what employers are offering to cope with stress. While nearly half of (47%) employed professionals wish to end work at reasonable hours, only about one-thirds (36%) were actually able to do so. Also, while 41% planned for time-off, only 30% could take time-off in the past two months. “These alarming statistics reflect the urgency for companies to understand how creating a culture that encourages work-life balance and prioritizes wellbeing is critical moving forward” stated by the Head of the survey company.(UGC NET HRM Jun 2022)We can conclude that:</div>

                    </div>
                    <div class="question-text">Read the passage below carefully and answer the question that follow:The invention of the office - from the Latin opus (work) + facere (do) = officium (performance of work) -was necessitated by the inability of work to be done remotely. Until very recently, the prevalent technology was simply not available or very limited to allow work away from office. If you had to conduct stocktaking, copy documents or engage in a brainstorming session, one had to be physically close to the tools of work and co-workers. Even as the technology was becoming increasingly available, it was the forced disruption of pandemic that finally showed that office, like the stock exchange trading floor, as a shared physical-only space was no longer essential to carry out work. Today, as Covid restrictions thankfully recede, the push that had become the shove of working from home (WFH) is becoming a nudge for working from anywhere (WFA).Neither can all work be conducted WFA nor to all workers prefer remote working. Several reasons for the primacy of the "face-to-face' work model are trotted out - 'water-cooler' engagements; ideas flying 'better' at corporeally attended meeting; company values welded only under 'one roof, one team' norms. But studies, including pre-pandemic ones conducted by the likes of Harvard Business School's Prithwiraj Choudhury, have shown that WFA is a 'win-win for 'Workers, Companies and for Society'. WFA slashes time and energy expanded in commutes; allows workers the choice of their work surroundings that may actually improve their quantitative and qualitative output; provides less crowded space for those who choose offices as their comfort work zone. Most importantly, for companies, it allows HFA - hiring from anywhere, thereby breaking the talent pool distance barrier.The new hybrid work culture is still a work-in progress. Floor managers will have to be trained to manage a different kind of floor. Company values will need to flourish in a digital-deeper environment. The idea of work-life balance itself has to be rejigged. But the bottom-line is work optimisation. For which WFA, without the stress of a pandemic around, makes damn good pitch.Given below are two statements in relation to the passage: (UGC NET Commerce Dec 2022)Statement I:With ease in the stress of the pandemic around, the relevance of Work from Anywhere will reduce.Statement II:For the new hybrid work culture to prevail, companies will have to invest more in technology.In light of the above statements, choose the most appropriate answer from the options given below:</div>

It emphasizes the importance of designing HR policies and practices to achieve four primary outcomes: strategic integration, high employee commitment to the organization, high workforce flexibility and adaptability, and a high-quality workforce. Guest argues that when these HRM outcomes are achieved, it results in high job performance, effective problem-solving, change consistent with strategic goals, and improved cost-effectiveness. This model suggests that a coherent strategy of HRM policies fully integrated into the business strategy, supported by all levels of line management, is necessary for these outcomes to be realized.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">In contrast, the other models—such as the Harvard model, Michigan model, Warwick model, and John M.

Each model brings unique approaches to managing the workforce, differing in their emphasis on factors such as control, human elements, and their role in achieving organizational success.</span></span></p></div>

The states in the model are defined by different categories, such as employment status or customer loyalty level. Each state has an associated probability of transitioning to another state in the following time period, which is typically one year.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">The Markov chain is represented as a matrix, with each row and column representing a different state.

External recruitment also broadens the scope for diverse talent and perspectives within the organization. However, rewarding good performance is more aligned with internal mechanisms such as promotions or incentives for existing employees.</span></span></p></div>

This particular test is a projective method used to assess an individual's patterns of thought, emotional responses, attitudes, and observational capacity through the interpretation of ambiguous visual stimuli.

This phenomenon isn't limited to a specific career stage; it can impact newcomers or seasoned professionals taking on new roles. During reality shock, individuals might realize that their job entails greater responsibilities or challenges than initially perceived from the job description. Additionally, navigating the internal workings of the company might prove more complex than anticipated. Consequently, this mismatch can lead to decreased enthusiasm, moments of self-doubt, and in severe cases, may even prompt an employee to leave the organization.</span></span></p></div>

Its primary objective is to help new employees acclimate comfortably and efficiently to their roles and the organizational environment. When individuals join a new workplace, they often feel like strangers, unfamiliar with their surroundings, colleagues, and the nature of the work environment. This sense of unfamiliarity can trigger insecurity, shyness, and nervousness among new hires. Without proper information and support, anxiety and fear may persist due to the disparity between their expectations and the actual situation, leading to what's known as "reality shock." Induction or orientation programs play a crucial role in mitigating these issues by providing essential information and guidance, aiding new employees in feeling a sense of belonging and gradually integrating into the organization.</span></span></p></div>
