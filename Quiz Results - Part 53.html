Sec 16(1) talks about a situation where the buyer has either expressly or impliedly told the seller that he relies on his (seller) skills and judgements for a good that the seller deals in his ordinary course of business, then there is an implied condition that the goods shall reasonably be in accordance with the said purpose.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">2. Sec. 16(2) talks about merchantable quality which is one more exception. It talks about the fact that the seller who sells goods by description has a duty to ensure that those goods are of proper merchantable quality i.e. if they are resold then they should be </span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">in a position</span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt"> to be passed of under the same market description. This however is subject to the condition that the buyer did not have reasonable opportunity to examine the goods. If he did then this would not apply.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">3. Sec 16(3) provides for an exception where the conditions are implied by the usage of this </span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">particular trade</span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">. So, in a case there is an implied warranty with regards to the fitness and quality of the goods and seller doesn't abide by that then in that case, the seller would be liable.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">4. In a case, where an order has been in bulk and the buyer checks only a small sample and then if the bulk doesn't coincide with the </span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">sample</span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt"> then the buyer won't be held responsible. For example, if one person orders a particular type of a notebook in a huge </span></span><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">quantity and checks only one, and the others come out to be different then this doctrine won't be applicable.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">5. The final exception to this rule applies to the scenario when the seller has obtained the consent of the buyer by fraud or misrepresentation then this doctrine would not apply. Moreover, if the seller willingly conceals any material defects which the buyer later comes to know about then also the buyer won't be liable.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Therefore, correct answer is option D.</span></span></p></div>

There may be a contract for the sale of goods the acquisition of which by the seller depends upon a contingency which may or may not happen. Such contacts are called contingent contracts. Whereby a contract of sale the seller purports to effect a present sale of future goods, the contract operates as an agreement to sell the goods.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#C00000"><span style="font-size:11.5pt"><img alt="" height="208" src="./Quiz Results - Part 53_files/image1.png" width="601"></span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">Existing Goods</span></span></strong></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">The goods that are referred to in the contract of sale are termed as existing goods if they are present (in existence) at the time of the contract. In sec 6 of the Act, the existing goods are those goods which are in the legal possession or are owned by the seller at the time of the formation of the contract of sale. </span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">The existing goods are further of the following types:</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">Specific Goods: </span></span></strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">According to the sec 2(14) of the Act, these are those goods that are “</span></span><em><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">identified and agreed upon</span></span></em><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">” when the contract of sale is formed. For example, if one wants to sell his mobile phone online. A buyer agrees to the sale and a contract is formed. The mobile, in this case, is specific good.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">Unascertained Goods: </span></span></strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">These are the goods that have not been specifically identified but have rather been left to be selected from a larger group. For example, if the seller has 500 kg of sugar to sell and out of this 500 kg sugar, the buyer wants to buy only 10 kg of sugar. Then this 10 kg of sugar has not been specifically identified and been left to be selected from a larger set of 500 kg sugar. In other words, the buyer or seller is yet to decide which quantity of 10 kg sugar will be sold or bought out of 500 Kg of sugar.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">Ascertained Goods: </span></span></strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">This is a type not defined by the law but by the judicial interpretation. This term is used for specific goods which have been selected from a larger set of goods. From the example above, the moment, the 10kg of sugar is identified or separated from whole lot of 500 kg sugar, forming part of sale, it becomes ascertained goods. (These are also called specific or existing goods).</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">2. Future Goods</span></span></strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">: In sec 2(6) of the Act, future goods have been defined as the goods that will either be manufactured or produced or acquired by the seller at the time the contract of sale is made. The contract for the sale of future goods will never have the actual sale in it, it will always be an agreement to sell. For example, you have an apple orchard with apples in it. You agree to sell 1000 apples to a buyer after the apples ripe. This is a sale that has to occur in the future, but the goods have been identified already and the agreement made. Such goods are known as future goods.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1;"><strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">3. Contingent Goods: </span></span></strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">Contingent goods are actually a subtype of future goods in the sense that in contingent goods the actual sale is to be done in the future. These goods are part of a sale contract that has some contingency clause in it. For example, if you sell your apples from your orchard when the trees are yet to produce apples, the apples are a contingent good. This sale is dependent on the condition that the trees are able to produce apples, which may not happen.</span></span></p></div>

The car turns out to be unfit for touring purposes. Here the term that the ‘car should be suitable for touring purposes’ is a condition of the contract.

In sec 6 of the Act, the existing goods are those goods which are in the legal possession or are owned by the seller at the time of the formulation of the contract of sale. The existing goods are further of the following types:</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">(a) </span></span><em><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">Specific Goods:</span></span></em><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt"> According to the sec 2(14) of the Act, these are those goods that are “identified and agreed upon” when the contract of sale is formed. For example, one want to sell his mobile phone online. He puts an advertisement with its picture and information. A buyer agrees to the sale and a contract is formed. The mobile, in this case, is specific good.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">(b) </span></span><em><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">Ascertained Goods:</span></span></em><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt"> This is a type not defined by the law but by the judicial interpretation. This term is used for specific goods which have been selected from a larger set of goods. For example, a person has 500 apples. Out of these 500 apples, he decides to sell 200 apples. To sell these 200 apples, he will need to separate them from the 500 (larger set). Thus he specifies 200 apples from a larger group of unspecified apples. These 200 apples are now the ascertained goods.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;"><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">(c) </span></span><em><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">Unascertained Goods:</span></span></em><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt"> These are the goods that have not been specifically identified but have rather been left to be selected from a larger group.

The contract for the sale of future goods will never have the actual sale in it, it will always be an agreement to sell. For example, the person has an apple orchard with apples in it. He agree to sell 1000 apples to a buyer after the apples ripe. This is a sale that has to occur in the future but the goods have been identified already and the agreement made. Such goods are known as future goods.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1;"><strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">3. Contingent Goods:</span></span></strong><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt"> Contingent goods are actually a subtype of future goods in the sense that in contingent goods the actual sale is to be done in the future. These goods are part of a sale contract that has some contingency clause in it. For example, if a person sells his apples from his orchard when the trees are yet to produce apples, the apples are a contingent good. This sale is dependent on the condition that the trees are able to produce apples, which may not happen.</span></span></p></div>

Earlier it was six (6) months from the date of the cheque. Once the cheque becomes stale the payee or the holder has to approach the drawer for revalidation of the cheque, which means the drawer puts the current date and authenticates it by signing fully with or without the words revalidated. However, due changes in the process of clearing of cheques electronically where the original cheque is not presented to the bank, but only a scanned image is being sent, the rules have been modified to accept only cheques without any alterations. So, the drawer has to issue a fresh cheque with the current date in lieu of the stale cheque returned.</span></span></p></div>

The conditions that give rise to an oligopolistic market are also conducive to the formation of a cartel; in particular, cartels tend to arise in markets where there are few firms and each firm has a significant share of the market. In the U.S., cartels are illegal; however, internationally, there are no restrictions on cartel formation. The organization of petroleum‐exporting countries (OPEC) is perhaps the best‐known example of an international cartel; OPEC members meet regularly to decide how much oil each member of the cartel will be allowed to produce.</span></span></p><p style="line-height:1.1;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height:1;"><span lang="en" style="color:#C00000"><span lang="en" style="font-size:11.5pt">Oligopolistic firms join a cartel to increase their market power, and members work together to determine jointly the level of output that each member will produce and/or the price that each member will charge.</span></span></p></div>

This concept was not there in Companies Act, 1956.A Dormant Company offers excellent advantage to the promoters who want to hold an asset or intellectual property under the corporate shield for its usage at a later stage. For instance: if a promoter wants to buy lands now for its future project at a comparatively lesser price, he may do the same through dormant company so that he can use the land for its future project. Thus, dormant company status is a new phenomenon in the Companies Act 2013 and is an excellent tool for keeping assets in the company for its future usage. A dormant company may be either a public company or a private company or a one person company.Certain companies, due to the nature of their business, may not be able to start any business, for a long time from the date of incorporation as for instance any business for creation of intellectual property or for a future project and has no significant accounting transaction. Such a company may be an Inactive company". Construction Companies/Real Estate Companies incorporate New Companies to hold land/properties for future projects. This concept is beneficial for them. By this concept, they can Incorporate Company and purchase property/land in that company and get status of Dormant Company. If a company gets status of dormant company, there are less compliance in dormant company in comparison of active company. It will help to save cost of compliances for inactive companies.Given below are two statements: (UGC NET Commerce Jun 2022)One is labelled as Assertion A and the other is labelled as Reason R.Assertion A: If a company gets status of a dormant company, then it is subject to less compliance in comparison to active company.Reasons R: It will help to save of compliances for Inactive companies when they become dormant company under section 455 of the Companies Act, 2013 as compared to the Companies Act, 1956.In the light of the above statements, choose the most appropriate answer from the options given below:</div>
